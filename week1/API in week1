1. StringBuilder
	
	StringBuilder is a class compatible with StringBuffer, but without guarantee of synchronization. It is frequently used to append or insert a string 
	to a existing string. Because String instance cannot be modified, if you want to use "+" symbol to realize appending, a new String instance have to 
	be created, which will allocate another piece of memory space. By using StirngBuilder class and its API, you just need to apply for one part of space
	and modify this part of space directly.

	StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder(String str);

	StringBuilder append(any primitive): Appends the string representation of the argument to this sequence.
	StringBuilder insert(int offset, any primitive): Insert the string representation of the argument into sequence[offset] location.
	StringBuilder reverse(): Causes this character sequence to be replaced by the reverse of the sequence.
	String toString(): Returns a string representing the data in this sequence.
